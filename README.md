### Features

1. **Total Mesh Vertices Count:** Displays the total number of vertices in all meshes present in the scene.

2. **Texture Memory:**
   - Material Texture Memory: Shows the memory consumed by textures used in materials.
   - Lightmap Texture Memory: Indicates the memory usage by lightmap textures.
   - Reflection Probe Texture Memory: Provides insight into the memory allocated for reflection probe textures.

3. **Unique Materials Count:** Presents the number of unique materials present in the scene.

4. **Lightmaps Detection:** Indicates whether lightmaps are present in the scene or not.

5. **Light Probes Detection:** Determines whether light probes are present in the scene or not.

6. **High Poly Collision Mesh Collider Detection:** Identifies the presence of high poly collision mesh colliders in the scene.

7. **Interactive Buttons:**
